# Supervised Machine Learning Labs from Scratch

A hands-on project for implementing foundational supervised machine learning algorithms and labs, based on coursework from Coursera course [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). This repository includes Jupyter notebooks with self-coded versions of each algorithm.

## Description

This project is a personal collection of implementations for supervised machine learning algorithms covered in the Supervised Machine Learning course. While the course provides pre-written code for labs, each algorithm here is coded from scratch to deepen my understanding and practice Python coding. The notebooks include comments and explanations to make each implementation clear and accessible. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Common libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

### Installing

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/chengzwk/supervisedML-implementations.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Executing Program

To view and run the notebooks:

1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired notebook file and run the cells to execute the code step-by-step.

## Help

For common issues or troubleshooting:

- Make sure your libraries are updated to the required versions.
- If you encounter compatibility issues, try setting up a virtual environment with the correct dependencies.
